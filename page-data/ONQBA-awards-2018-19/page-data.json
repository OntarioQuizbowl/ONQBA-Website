He did not win the quizbowl tournament he played, but the <a href=\"https://hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/5674/stats/with_final/teamdetail/#t0\">stats</a> say he was probably the best player there.</p>\n<p><em>Unanimous.</em></p>\n<h2>Most Improved Player - Amy Wang (Westmount)</h2>\n<p>Amy won Reach Nationals this year, and she scored a ton of powers in <a href=\"https://hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/5799/stats/day_2_round_robin/teamdetail/#t10\">summer open tournaments</a>. Unlike most players from Hamilton, she has the self-control not to neg in every game.</p>\n<p><em>Also got votes: Sreesa Virinchi (UTS)</em></p>\n<h2>Best Junior Player - Gabriel McMurren (Glebe)</h2>\n<p>The Provincial champions Glebe were a balanced team, and their grade 10 player Gabriel led them in powers.
