_These are our awards to recognize great players in Ontario. We consider all trivia formats, with some preference for achievements in actual quizbowl._

## Best Player - Oliver Weizel (UTS)

Oliver won the nationals of both History Bee and Bowl this year. He did not win the quizbowl tournament he played, but the [stats](https://hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/5674/stats/with_final/teamdetail/#t0) say he was probably the best player there.

_Unanimous._

## Most Improved Player - Amy Wang (Westmount)

Amy won Reach Nationals this year, and she scored a ton of powers in [summer open tournaments](https://hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/5799/stats/day_2_round_robin/teamdetail/#t10). Unlike most players from Hamilton, she has the self-control not to neg in every game.

_Also got votes: Sreesa Virinchi (UTS)_

## Best Junior Player - Gabriel McMurren (Glebe)

The Provincial champions Glebe were a balanced team, and their grade 10 player Gabriel led them in powers. I have a great memory of him buzzing "[Sergeant Preston of the Yukon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_Preston_of_the_Yukon_(TV_series))," because (of course) it came up in practice.

_Also got votes: David Landry (Lisgar)_
